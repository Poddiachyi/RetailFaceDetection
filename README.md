# RetailFaceDetection

A project from AI Spring Hackathon 2018.

A CV system which would look at people emotions (also gender and age) when they enter and when they leave a place. By matching faces, the system will analyze how well a person was served, whether he leaves sad or happy. Another part of the project was criminals detection. When a person enters a place, his face would be run through a database of criminals and in case of finding a match, the system would notify the security service.

It's rather a concept than a working project.

See output.avi for the result.
